/**
 * End-to-end tests for `tools/check_lockfile_drift.js`.
 *
 * The verdict function is covered exhaustively in lockfile_drift.test.ts. What
 * those tests cannot reach is everything between the CLI entry point and that
 * function: the `contents?ref=` URL for each branch, the base64/JSON decode,
 * the per-ref status branching, and the exit code. Without the cases below the
 * whole check could be deleted — or wired to read one ref twice — with the
 * suite still green, which is the same silent-control failure the check itself
 * exists to catch on the Dependabot side.
 *
 * Each case spawns the real CLI against a fake `gh` on PATH. The last case is
 * the exception and covers the one thing spawning the CLI cannot: that the
 * workflow invokes it at all. A guard that never runs and a guard that runs
 * clean look identical from here.
