/**
 * SB-10 U8 — deferred re-grounding delivery at the admit seams.
 *
 * Node port of Python `_reground_qualifies` / `_claim_reground_context` /
 * `_attach_reground` / `_deliver_pending_reground` (agent-coherence a69a68d,
 * coordinator_server.py). The compact-pending flag armed by
 * /hooks/session-start is claimed — atomic test-and-clear — at the
 * allow-attach seam shared by the four admit surfaces (pre-read, pre-edit,
 * pre-bash, pre-grep), and the payload rides a PreToolUse envelope, never
 * the SessionStart wrapper. It only ever ADDS context: a bare admit gets a
 * context-only envelope, an existing envelope keeps its own decision (see
 * `attachReground`).
 *
 * R2 at-most-once: the claim happens ONLY here, after every deny decision.
 * Node's single-threaded event loop already makes the Map-delete pop atomic,
 * but the claim-at-attach shape is kept so the contract survives any future
 * multi-writer transport. R8: allow envelopes only — a non-qualifying result
 * is returned as the SAME object (deny bodies stay byte-identical) and keeps
 * the flag pending; a request presenting an agent_id field (subagent
 * identity) neither consumes nor attaches. KTD2 rebuild-at-delivery: the
 * prose is rebuilt from registry truth via `buildSessionStartContext` at the
 * moment of attach — never a snapshot cached at compact time.

 * (KTD-P) and must NOT consume: the flag survives for the next qualifying
 * admit. An envelope-less response qualifies iff it is an admit body —
 * `{ok: true}` (pre-edit) or `{status: "fresh"}` (pre-read / pre-bash /

 * neither consume nor attach), when no flag is pending, or when the rebuild
 * came back empty (state drained since the compact event — nothing left
 * worth re-grounding).
 *
 * Failure containment: re-grounding is advisory (KD3). A rebuild error
 * after a won claim must not turn an otherwise-successful admit into an
 * internal-error body, so the build is guarded and the delivery is
 * forfeited (R2 permits at-most-once → zero) rather than propagated.

/**
 * Merge the claimed re-grounding prose into a qualifying admit response.
 * An existing envelope keeps its text and its decision and gets the block
 * appended AFTER it (notices and stale warnings render first — KTD6
 * ordering); a bare admit body gets a CONTEXT-ONLY PreToolUse envelope —
 * `hookEventName` + `additionalContext`, no `permissionDecision`.
 *
 * WHY context-only (SB-10 review finding): an advisory payload must NEVER
 * widen a permission decision. `permissionDecision: "allow"` short-circuits
 * Claude Code's own permission prompting for that tool call, so promoting a
 * bare untracked admit (the fast-path `{ok:true}` / `{status:"fresh"}` body,
 * which carries no decision of its own) to an allow envelope would, once per
 * compaction, auto-approve an untracked bash or edit that would otherwise
 * have prompted the user — purely as a side effect of re-grounding delivery.
 * Re-grounding is advisory (KD3): it may add context, never authority.
 *
 * Empirically safe: an A/B capture against Claude Code CLI 2.1.233 showed a
 * PreToolUse `hookSpecificOutput` carrying `additionalContext` with NO
 * `permissionDecision` has its context rendered to the model (the primed
 * model quoted the injected line verbatim); the control arm that also
 * stamped `allow` behaved identically. Minting an allow buys nothing and
 * costs a permission gate.
 *
 * The deferred path rides the PreToolUse wrapper — never the SessionStart
 * shape. Wire-shape parity with Python `_attach_reground` is load-bearing
 * (protocol corpus): same key set, same insertion order.
