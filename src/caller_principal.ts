/**
 * Caller principal — the hook client's half (library caller-principal plan, U5).
 *
 * The bearer in `.coherence/hook.secret` authenticates the WORKSPACE. A caller
 * principal is a value a coordinator mints and binds to ONE acting identity on
 * that identity's first claim (`POST /principal/claim`, Python coordinator
 * only); a request naming the identity presents it in the
 * `Coherence-Caller-Principal` header. Once a session is bound, the Python
 * coordinator refuses a request naming it without that principal on the routes
 * where an absent principal admits harm (pre-edit, post-edit, post-edit-cas,
 * session-stop, ...); a session nobody has claimed is admitted without one and
 * counted (KTD15), which is what keeps a client that predates principals
 * working. A presented principal that is not the bound one is refused on every
 * route. This Node coordinator issues none: it answers 404 on the claim and
 * ignores the header. Its pid file says `backend=node`, so against it the
 * client does not claim at all — one request per hook, exactly as before,
 * instead of a 404 round trip on every event. A pid file without that line
 * (the Python coordinator's format) is claimed against, and a 404 there (an
 * older Python coordinator) still means "send no header".
 *
 * A refusal is HTTP 400 carrying a typed `reason` (`caller_principal_absent` /
 * `caller_principal_foreign`), and the client classifies it by that key alone,
 * never by the error prose. It recovers the one way that cannot reopen the
 * first-claim gate: a re-claim presenting the SAME stored mint nonce (R20). A
 * coordinator that lost its bindings (state.db removed or restored) binds the
 * session afresh to that nonce; one that still holds the binding hands its
 * principal back; one holding it under a different nonce refuses, and the
 * client reports that and stops. A principal the re-claim returns replaces the
 * stored one and the refused request is retried once — a refused request
 * changed nothing, so the retry cannot apply anything twice.
 *
 * Parity with the Python client (`ccs/cli/_coherence_client.py`
 * `obtain_stored_principal` + `ccs/adapters/claude_code/auth.py`):
 * - One process per hook event, so the values live on disk in the existing
 *   0700 `.coherence/`, at 0600. The nonce is created with O_CREAT|O_EXCL — the
 *   hook.secret discipline — and never rewritten or removed. A nonce file that
 *   exists but holds no complete nonce is waited on (bounded) only while it is
 *   young enough to be a racer's write in progress; an older one is reported at
 *   once, naming the file and the operator's step, and the session runs without
 *   a principal until it is removed by hand. The principal is written whole to
 *   a temporary file and renamed into place, so no reader sees it torn; it is
 *   replaced only by a value the coordinator handed back for the stored nonce,
 *   never by a claim under a new one.
 * - Keyed by the PARENT session's derived agent id (32 hex), never the raw
 *   session id: `caller-principal-<key>.nonce` / `.principal`. The file names
 *   and formats are identical across the two clients, so they share one
 *   binding per session.
 * - The mint nonce is persisted BEFORE the claim is sent (so a retry after a
 *   lost response presents the same nonce and receives the same principal); a
 *   concurrent loser of the exclusive create adopts the winner's nonce.
 * - A refused claim (`caller_principal_claimed`) is reported and the client
 *   proceeds without a principal. It never deletes a stored value and never
 *   claims under a new nonce: that would reopen the gate first-claim-wins
 *   closes.
 * - Nothing prints a principal or a nonce (R5): a report carries a typed
 *   reason, an HTTP status, a file path or a transport error, never the
 *   coordinator's prose.
 *
 * What this buys on the hook surface is convention-enforcement and a
 * detectable unbound caller: any process that can read `.coherence/` can read
 * these files for any session, so it is not separation between callers of the
 * same OS user.
