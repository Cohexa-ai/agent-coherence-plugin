/**
 * Coordinator version, read from package.json at startup.
 *
 * package.json is the single source of truth — the previous hand-maintained
 * `VERSION` constant in coordinator.ts silently drifted (stuck at 0.1.1
 * through the 0.2.x/0.3.x releases). A static `import ... from
 * "../package.json"` can't replace it: tsconfig pins `rootDir: "src"`, and
 * pulling package.json into the program would violate that (or force a
 * dist/src/* layout change). Runtime read keeps the dist layout untouched.
 *
 * Layout invariant: package.json sits one directory above this compiled
 * module (dist/version.js → repo root). That holds in the repo checkout and
 * in installed plugins, where bin/ensure-coordinator-node stages package.json
 * (Stage 1) and dist/ (Stage 2) as siblings under ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA} —
 * and Stage 4 only spawns the coordinator after Stage 1 guaranteed the copy.
 * version_source.test.ts pins the resolution.
